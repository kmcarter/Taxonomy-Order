== Description ==

Have you ever wanted to sort your built in categories(hierarchical) and tags(non-hierarchical) taxonomies terms with simple Ajax Drag and Drop Interface right from their standard list? Have you ever tried a plugin that implements some sort of custom taxonomy but their lacks support for drag and drop interface?

As the name suggests this plugin is intended toward taxonomy terms order with awesome drag and drop support. If your wordpress website is one of the content source or blog then for sometime it becomes hard for you to managed categories or taxonomies. Than, this plugin is definitely for you. Using it you can enable Ajax Drag and Drop Interface for ordering built in taxonomies (i.e categories and tags). But not only, you can set it to enable custom ordering of any other taxonomy’s terms, even taxonomies created by other plugins too.

By default, Ajax Drag and Drop Interface is enable for your posts categories and tags. But if you want to order any other taxonomy then check out [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-order/faq/) Page.
